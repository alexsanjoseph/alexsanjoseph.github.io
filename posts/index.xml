      <description>At VIMANA, we have an Elasticsearch backend for storing most of our Big Data. While Elasticsearch is an amazing search engine which can do a variety of queries/aggregations, the Elasticsearch Query DSL is difficult to construct, especialy for newcomers. I have spent countless hours trying to get the brackets right and the searching for the specific terms. While the new SQL options allows the user to query using SQL, that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all the capabilities supported by the full DSL.</description>

      <description>Introduction For a real life working example, we have this dataset graciously provided to us by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (http://www.nist.gov/) for one of their test bed parts. We will be trying to solve the first example from the introduction, which was a real problem faced by the NIST researchers. As we walk through each step of the exploratory process, you will understand how you can use similar techniques to solve similar issues that you might have with your Machine Tools.</description>
