    <p>There&rsquo;s been plenty written about individual AI coding experiences (<a href="/posts/20250803-escapades-with-ai-volkswagen/">some by me</a>), but what I haven&rsquo;t seen much of is how working with AI changes when you&rsquo;re actually part of a team. This feels like something we have all collectively ignored although most of us are working in teams in this brave new world we have found ourselves in.</p>
<p>At Netrin, we&rsquo;ve had to rethink several core software engineering processes, and we&rsquo;ve found pretty good results with the changes.</p>
<blockquote class="info">
    <strong>We primarily use Claude Code for development work. We previously used Cursor but have transitioned almost entirely to Claude Code for our day-to-day coding and automation workflows.</strong><br>
    
</blockquote>
<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>
<p>Important caveat up front: everything I&rsquo;m describing works for us as a small team at Netrin. We&rsquo;re 6-8 people - designers, frontend developers, backend engineers - all pretty high-functioning. While this setup works for us,  I&rsquo;m honestly conflicted about how any of this scales to larger organizations.</p>
<p>The processes I&rsquo;m about to describe are specifically calibrated for small, tight-knit teams. Your mileage may vary dramatically at enterprise scale.</p>
<h2 id="what-changed-for-us">What Changed for Us</h2>
<h3 id="shorter-iteration-cycles">Shorter Iteration Cycles</h3>
<p>First major change: our personal velocity did increase dramatically. We used to run two-week iterations - pretty standard stuff. We have very light agile processes with daily 10-15 minute stand-ups and bi-weekly backlog refinement sessions. Most stories would take 1-2 weeks from start to finish.</p>
<p>With AI doing the heavy lifting, we can now complete full cycles (design to deployment and validation) within a single week for most stories. This shift to one-week iterations has made us significantly more agile.</p>
<h3 id="the-pr-avalanche">The PR Avalanche</h3>
<p>Without exaggeration, AI writes about 90-95% of our code now. This creates an interesting problem as a team - we&rsquo;re spending most of our time reviewing PRs rather than writing code and constantly stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p>We used to have 4-5 PRs across our entire two-week sprint. Now we&rsquo;re dealing with 5-10 PRs in flight at any given time within a single week.</p>
<p>The volume of PRs led us to adopt <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">stacked PRs</a> as a standard practice. When one person&rsquo;s work depends on another&rsquo;s, we stack the PRs and merge upstream changes downstream. This keeps everyone&rsquo;s changes in the staging environments intact during the deployment chain.</p>
<p>With so many PRs in flight, ordering becomes critical. We&rsquo;ve developed a structured approach to PR naming:</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: <code>&lt;APP-ID&gt;-&lt;VERSION&gt;-&lt;ORDER&gt; | &lt;BRANCH&gt; | &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;</code></p>
<p>This naming convention solves several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency tracking</strong>: Order numbers (0, 1, 2&hellip;) show the merge sequence for stacked PRs</li>
<li><strong>Version grouping</strong>: All PRs for version 0.7.1 start with <code>FN-0.7.1-</code></li>
<li><strong>Quick context</strong>: Branch names and descriptions provide immediate context without opening the PR</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve automated this with custom Claude commands (more on this later) that analyze the PR chain, extract versions from our config files, and generate consistent titles. When you&rsquo;re dealing with 5-10 PRs in flight, this structure becomes essential for keeping everyone aligned on what merges when.</p>

<h3 id="git-worktrees-are-mvps">Git Worktrees are MVPs</h3>
<p>Git worktrees have become indispensable for AI-accelerated development. When you have multiple AI &ldquo;genies&rdquo; working on different problems across the codebase simultaneously, context switching becomes a major bottleneck.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re in the middle of implementing a feature and waiting for Claude to generate code, you often need to review someone else&rsquo;s PR. Rather than checking out a new branch in your current workspace and breaking &ldquo;your flow&rdquo; (aka Claude context), we maintain 1-2 additional worktrees specifically for PR reviews.</p>
<p>This setup lets us stay productive during AI generation cycles and keeps our main development context intact while handling the constant stream of reviews that AI-generated code requires.</p>
<h3 id="custom-claude-commands-for-development-workflows">Custom Claude Commands for Development Workflows</h3>
<p>Beyond PR naming, we&rsquo;ve built custom Claude commands for most of our development workflows for managing the increased complexity that comes with AI-accelerated development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release management</strong>: Commands that handle version bumping, changelog generation, and release preparation</li>
<li><strong>Error monitoring</strong>: Query Sentry MCP for recent issues and correlate them with recent deployments</li>
<li><strong>PR chain management</strong>: Automatically merge PRs downstream across stacked PR chains. Any conflicts are fixed manually</li>
</ul>
<p>These automations weren&rsquo;t strictly necessary in our slower, pre-AI workflow. But when you&rsquo;re moving fast and managing multiple concurrent features, having these workflows scripted becomes critical for maintaining quality.</p>
<h3 id="intensified-code-review-process">Intensified Code Review Process</h3>
<p>The thing about AI is that it is not going to take responsibility and get shouted at when things break in production. You still need to understand what&rsquo;s happening in your codebase to protect your rear-end.</p>
<p>Our PR review process has become more rigorous:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-review first</strong>: Every developer reviews their own AI-generated PR thoroughly before submitting</li>
<li><strong>Complexity-based assignment</strong>: Simple changes get one reviewer, complex ones get two</li>
<li><strong>More aggressive reviews</strong>: We learned early that it&rsquo;s easy to gloss over AI-generated code, so we&rsquo;ve become more nitpicky</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge propagation</strong>: For complex stories, multiple reviewers ensure the changes are well-understood across the team</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-quality-over-quantity">Test Quality Over Quantity</h3>
<p>With AI writing most of the implementation code, we&rsquo;ve had to double down on test quality. AI tends to write extremely brittle tests - the kind where any line change breaks everything.</p>
<p>Currently, we focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following existing conventions</strong>: Tests should match our established patterns and use proper fixtures</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral testing</strong>: Focus on what users actually care about, not implementation details</li>
<li><strong>Writing maintainable tests</strong>: Resist AI&rsquo;s tendency toward over-specific, fragile assertions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternating-rhythm-code-days-vs-review-days">Alternating Rhythm: Code Days vs Review Days</h3>
<p>The time allocation shift has been dramatic. Previously, we spent most of our sprint writing code, with PR reviews clustered in the final days. Now it&rsquo;s flipped - most time goes to reviewing the mountain of AI-generated PRs.</p>
<p>Our solution: <strong>alternating days within a week/iteration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1</strong>: Code generation</li>
<li><strong>Day 2</strong>: Reviews and merges</li>
<li><strong>Day 3</strong>: Code generation</li>
<li><strong>Day 4</strong>: Reviews and merges</li>
<li><strong>Day 5</strong>: Backlog cleanup, admin, and validation</li>
</ul>
<p>This rhythm prevents the PR avalanche from becoming unmanageable.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="velocity-2x-not-10x">Velocity: 2x, Not 10x</h3>
<p>The team is genuinely happy with how this has played out. Our velocity has roughly doubled across the board - measured by story points, which we track religiously at Netrin.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/working-with-ai/velocity-going-up.png"
    alt="Despite what you might think, we actually don&amp;rsquo;t hate Jira" width="50%"><figcaption>
      <p>Despite what you might think, we actually don&rsquo;t hate Jira</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see claims online about 10x productivity gains, but that hasn&rsquo;t been our experience. For a small team like ours, 2x feels realistic and sustainable. More experienced developers seem to extract slightly better gains from AI tools, but everyone has seen meaningful productivity improvements.</p>
<h3 id="the-todo-list-finally-gets-attention">The TODO List Finally Gets Attention</h3>
<p>With doubled velocity, we&rsquo;re finally tackling those perpetual TODO items that every codebase accumulates. More importantly, we&rsquo;re shipping user delight features - the small touches that make products feel polished but never make it onto the roadmap because &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s asking for this specifically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suspect AI will raise the bar for UI/UX quality across the board. When implementation becomes cheaper, polish becomes more viable.</p>
<h3 id="architecture-creep-is-very-hard-to-defend-against">Architecture Creep is very hard to defend against</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all sunshine and doubled velocity.</p>
<p>When adding features becomes this convenient, it&rsquo;s incredibly tempting to just&hellip; add them. AI makes it so easy to implement a quick fix or new capability that you don&rsquo;t always step back to consider how it fits into the broader system architecture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve caught ourselves shipping features that work perfectly but don&rsquo;t belong where we put them. The convenience factor is almost too good - why spend time architecting the proper solution when AI can give you something that works right now?</p>
<p>We have to be absolutely zen to be disciplined about architectural reviews and system design discussions before we let AI loose on implementation. I actually believe the code quality of new code has declined maybe 10% in the last few weeks, but that seems like a reasonable tradeoff for the 100% increase in velocity that we see.</p>
<h2 id="the-million-dollar-question">The Million Dollar Question</h2>
<p>So, is software engineering becoming obsolete?</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s exactly the opposite. Yes, fewer people will be needed for pure code generation (I do worry about the huge lower-end consulting economy), but the core bottleneck of software engineering has always been communication - understanding what exactly the product needs and translating that into working systems.</p>
<p>That bottleneck hasn&rsquo;t moved. The hardest part was never writing the code. When it takes <a href="https://x.com/iamharaldur/status/1955780047123464383">18 months for an edit feature in Twitter</a> to go from ideation to production, that is not because they were writing code for 17 months on this feature.</p>
<p>Requirements are complex and (<a href="/posts/20250714-specifications-as-code-reality-check/">human beings are predictably bad</a>) at explaining what they need very clearly.</p>
<p>If anything, AI makes <strong>good</strong> software engineering skill more valuable, not less.</p>
