  <div class="post">
    <p>In my previous posts, I explained how I was stuck in the Running Plateau and the science-based training approach that helped me break through it. I detailed the principles of zone-based training, proper recovery, strategic intervals, and structured periodization that formed the foundation of my new approach.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m sharing what matters most: the results. Did this methodical, data-driven approach actually work?</p>
<h2 id="improved-pace-the-10k-breakthrough">Improved Pace: The 10K Breakthrough</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the headline number – my 10K pace progression over the years:</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/10k-progression.png" alt="10K progression improvements"></p>
<p>Looking at my 10K progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2014-2018</strong>: 7:00 → 6:20 (The Youth: 40 second improvement in 4 years)</li>
<li><strong>2018-2022</strong>: 6:20 → 6:19 (The Plateau: 1 second improvement in 4 years)</li>
<li><strong>2022-2024</strong>: 6:19 → 5:39 (The Wisdom: 40 seconds further improvement in 2 years)</li>
</ul>
<p>The acceleration of improvement is unmistakable. After four years of stagnation where I improved by just one second, I suddenly shaved off 40 seconds in half the time – and this happened in my mid-30s, when conventional wisdom suggests we should be slowing down.</p>
<p>What makes this even more remarkable is that I accomplished this while training at lower intensity most of the time. The traditional &ldquo;no pain, no gain&rdquo; approach would have predicted the opposite result.</p>
<h2 id="improved-efficiency-better-pace-at-the-same-effort">Improved Efficiency: Better Pace at the Same Effort</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of this transformation was seeing how my pace improved while maintaining the same heart rate:</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/pace-improvement-by-hr.png" alt="My average pace improved over time for all efforts Easy (140 bpm) to hardest (170bpm)"></p>
<p><em>My average pace improved over time for all efforts Easy (140 bpm) to hardest (170bpm)</em></p>
<p>The colored lines represent different heart rate zones. Notice how at the same heart rate (e.g., 140 bpm), I&rsquo;ve been able to run progressively faster over time. What used to require a 170 bpm effort now happens at 140-150 bpm – a significant reduction in cardiovascular strain.</p>
<p>This improvement in efficiency is perhaps the clearest indicator that the training approach is working. I&rsquo;m not just getting faster by pushing harder – I&rsquo;m getting faster while working the same or even less.</p>
<h2 id="realizing-real-consistency">Realizing REAL Consistency</h2>
<p>Prior to 2022, I thought I was already quite consistent with my running. I&rsquo;d show up 2-3 times a week, log my kilometers, and feel proud of my commitment. But looking at the data tells a different story:</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/running-consistency-distances.png" alt="The chart shows my running consistency and distances from 2016-2025. What looks like consistent training pre-2022 pales in comparison to what became possible with proper zone training."></p>
<p><em>The chart shows my running consistency and distances from 2016-2025. What looks like consistent training pre-2022 pales in comparison to what became possible with proper zone training.</em></p>
<p>The reason for this dramatic change was simple: my approach before 2022 was to push hard every run. The problem? Hard runs require hard recovery. I couldn&rsquo;t run as frequently because I was often sore, and when I did run, I wasn&rsquo;t fully recovered. This created a ceiling on both frequency and distance.</p>
<p>By limiting my hard efforts to 20% of my training, I unlocked a new level of consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li>More frequent runs (4-5 weekly vs. my previous 2-3)</li>
<li>Significantly longer distances (regular 15K+ runs became possible)</li>
<li>Proper recovery between sessions</li>
<li>Higher quality during the 20% of workouts that were truly intense</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="half-marathon-transformation">Half Marathon Transformation</h2>
<p>My half marathon performance illustrates the dramatic difference most clearly:</p>
<p><strong>2017 Half Marathon (age 29):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time: 2:46 (7:59/km pace)</li>
<li>Average HR: 170 bpm</li>
<li>Run pattern: Positive split (started fast, crashed hard)</li>
<li>Recovery: Multiple days of soreness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2025 Half Marathon (age 35):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time: 2:08 (6:07/km pace)</li>
<li>Average HR: 163 bpm</li>
<li>Run pattern: Even split (finished as strong as I started)</li>
<li>Recovery: Recovery run within 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only was I 38 minutes faster over 21 kilometers, but I did it with a lower heart rate, felt better throughout, and recovered more quickly – even though I was was 6 yrs older.</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/half-marathon-stats.jpg" alt="Half Marathon Stats"></p>
<p>Perhaps the most satisfying aspect was the dramatic difference in my 5K splits:</p>
<p><strong>2017 Half Marathon splits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First 5K: 7:38/km</li>
<li>Second 5K: 7:35/km</li>
<li>Third 5K: 8:07/km</li>
<li>Final 6.1K: 8:39/km (struggling to finish)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2025 Half Marathon splits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First 5K: 6:09/km</li>
<li>Second 5K: 6:04/km</li>
<li>Third 5K: 6:04/km</li>
<li>Final 6.1K: 6:09/km (finishing strong)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2017 race shows the classic &ldquo;positive split&rdquo; pattern of someone who hasn&rsquo;t built adequate endurance – starting too fast and gradually slowing down as fatigue sets in. The 2025 race demonstrates proper pacing and aerobic development, allowing for consistent effort throughout and even a strong finish. This wasn&rsquo;t just about being faster – it was about becoming a completely different kind of runner.</p>
<h2 id="the-delicious-side-effect-cookie-economics">The Delicious Side Effect: Cookie Economics</h2>
<p>One unexpected benefit of improved running efficiency? I can eat more cookies! Here&rsquo;s a fun visualization of the &ldquo;cookie dividend&rdquo; my running has paid over the years</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/cookies-burnt-chart.png" alt="Cookies Burnt Chart"></p>
<p>Notice the dramatic increase from 2022 onward. This isn&rsquo;t just because I&rsquo;m running faster – it&rsquo;s because improved efficiency allows me to run longer distances more frequently without burning out.</p>
<p>The caloric math is simple but powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, I burned approximately 40,500 calories through running (162 cookies)</li>
<li>In 2023, I burned approximately 97,750 calories (391 cookies)</li>
<li>In 2024, that increased to 137,000 calories (548 cookies)</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s an extra 386 cookies per year I can enjoy without weight gain – a tasty dividend from my training approach!</p>
<h2 id="from-personal-experiment-to-product-vision">From Personal Experiment to Product Vision</h2>
<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;m the co-founder and CTO of Netrin, so yes, what follows could be considered a sales pitch. But I&rsquo;m not promoting something I&rsquo;ve created and then passed off to others – I&rsquo;m sharing a system I personally use every single day. My own data tells the story better than any marketing could. At 35, I&rsquo;m in the best shape of my life, running faster and farther than I did at 25, all because of these principles.</p>
<p>What began as my personal experiment became Netrin&rsquo;s foundation: making science-based heart training accessible to everyone through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalized plans</strong> that adapt to your specific fitness level, goals, and available time</li>
<li><strong>Real-time guidance</strong> that keeps you in the right zones while you enjoy music or podcasts</li>
<li><strong>Accurate ECG monitoring</strong> that provides reliable data even during intense intervals</li>
<li><strong>Smart accountability features</strong> that help maintain consistency through life&rsquo;s interruptions</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools aren&rsquo;t just theoretical - they&rsquo;re the same ones I use daily. Whether you&rsquo;re starting fresh or unlearning habits like I did, the science works when applied consistently.</p>
<h2 id="the-transformation-goes-beyond-numbers">The Transformation Goes Beyond Numbers</h2>
<p>While the data tells a compelling story, what can&rsquo;t be captured in graphs is how my relationship with running has changed. Before this approach, running was often something I forced myself to do – a necessary evil for fitness. Now, it&rsquo;s something I genuinely enjoy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/beyond-the-plateau-transformation-results/bengaluru-half-marathon-photo.jpg" alt="Picture taken at the 20th km of Bengaluru Half Marathon 2024. Seven years earlier, this same point would have found me grimacing with fatigue rather than grinning for the camera."></p>
<p><em>Picture taken at the 20th km of Bengaluru Half Marathon 2024. Seven years earlier, this same point would have found me grimacing with fatigue rather than grinning for the camera.</em></p>
<h2 id="your-turn-breaking-through-your-own-plateau">Your Turn: Breaking Through Your Own Plateau</h2>
<p>If your running has stagnated, or if you&rsquo;re dreading workouts rather than looking forward to them, consider that the approach – not your potential – might be the limiting factor.</p>
<p>The science-based methods I&rsquo;ve described aren&rsquo;t just for elite athletes or data nerds like me. They&rsquo;re fundamental principles of human physiology that apply to everyone. When training aligns with how your body actually adapts and improves, progress becomes almost inevitable.</p>
<p>At Netrin, we&rsquo;re excited to bring these insights to everyone. If you&rsquo;re stuck in a fitness plateau or find yourself dreading workouts, there might be a better approach waiting for you – one that&rsquo;s backed by decades of exercise science and proven by my own transformation from the kid who couldn&rsquo;t run a lap to a comfortable half-marathoner (full Marathon in 2026 – here I come!).
