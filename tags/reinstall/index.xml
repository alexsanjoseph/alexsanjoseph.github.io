      <description>Intro So my (ostensibly high-end) Macbook Pro has been crawling the last few months whenever I connect it to external monitors. Generally it is still usable, however, after a lot of experimentation, I have found that like many things in life I have to make a tradeoff between two out of three things -
 Get on a zoom call (especially with video/screen sharing). Connect multiple monitors. Charge the laptop.  If I do all three of the above, within less than 10 minutes, my mac will start overheating and the dreaded kernel_task issue kicks in meaning that my computer is literally unusable.</description>
