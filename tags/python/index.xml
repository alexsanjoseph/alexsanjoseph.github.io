      <description>Introduction Are you in the Kubernetes bandwagon yet? We at VIMANA are fully bought into the ecosystem, which has been working out great for us because of the amazing abstractions and the ease of operations once everything has been properly setup. One thing that Kubernetes does is Automatic Bin Packing wherein the Kubernetes smartly allocates the pods on the the available nodes depending on the resource requirements. In AWS, Automatic scaling groups allow the system to expand and contract based on ephemeral demands, making sure that resources are not wasted when not required.</description>

As opposed to fully featured frameworks like Django and Flask, Streamlit is very opinionated as it has fewer features, but the advantage is you can deploy Streamlit app in under 5 minutes with no knowledge of APIs or routes. Streamlit has recently gotten very popular, especially among data scientists as a quick way to present their findings.</description>

      <description>Bodybuilder At VIMANA, we have an Elasticsearch backend for storing most of our Big Data. While Elasticsearch is an amazing search engine which can do a variety of queries/aggregations, the Elasticsearch Query DSL is difficult to construct, especialy for newcomers. I have spent countless hours trying to get the brackets right and the searching for the specific terms. While the new SQL options allows the user to query using SQL, that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all the capabilities supported by the full DSL.</description>
