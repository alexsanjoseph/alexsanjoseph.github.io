      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous posts, I explained how I was stuck in the Running Plateau and the science-based training approach that helped me break through it. I detailed the principles of zone-based training, proper recovery, strategic intervals, and structured periodization that formed the foundation of my new approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breaking the Plateau: A Data-Driven Approach to Running</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I shared my 8-year running journey and the frustrating 4-year plateau I couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to break through. I described how despite consistent effort, my 10K time improved by only 1 second over four long years. Today, I want to dive into the science and methodology that finally broke that plateau.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, this is Alex, CTO and Co-founder of Netrin. This post chronicles my unlikely transformation from a kid who couldn&amp;rsquo;t run a single lap without gasping for air to someone who now comfortably logs half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
