      <description>Introduction For a real life working example, we have this dataset graciously provided to us by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (http://www.nist.gov/) for one of their test bed parts. We will be trying to solve the first example from the introduction, which was a real problem faced by the NIST researchers. As we walk through each step of the exploratory process, you will understand how you can use similar techniques to solve similar issues that you might have with your Machine Tools.</description>
